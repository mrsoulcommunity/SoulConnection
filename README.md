> **A modern V2Ray / Xray client for Windows — Persian UI, built with React and Electron.**

Soul Connection is a desktop client for managing and connecting to VMess, VLESS, Trojan and
Shadowsocks servers. It wraps the Xray core behind a clean, fully Persian interface, and adds
subscription management, a smart server finder with real latency and speed testing, live traffic
stats, a firewall-backed kill switch, and full-tunnel (TUN) mode.

## 📥 Download

Grab the latest `setup.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mrsoulcommunity/SoulConnection/releases/latest).

A single installer covers **both 32-bit (ia32) and 64-bit (x64) Windows** — it detects your
system and installs the matching build. Windows 10 or later is recommended.

Because the installer is not code-signed, SmartScreen may warn on first run. Choose
**More info → Run anyway**. Some antivirus products also flag the bundled `xray.exe`; if the app
reports that `xray.exe` is missing, add the install folder to your antivirus exclusions and
reinstall.

## ✨ Features

- **Protocols** — VMess, VLESS (incl. Reality / XTLS Vision), Trojan, and Shadowsocks.
- **Transports** — TCP, WebSocket, gRPC, HTTP/2, mKCP, with TLS and Reality.
- **Two connection modes** — System Proxy (default) or full-device Tunnel (TUN, needs admin).
- **Subscriptions** — import by URL, refresh manually or on a timer, with remaining-quota display.
- **Bulk paste** — paste one link or a whole wall of them at once; every valid config is
  extracted and deduplicated automatically.
- **Server Finder** — test ping, real latency through the tunnel, and download/upload speed, then
  sort servers by a combined score.
- **Kill Switch** — Windows Firewall rules that block all outbound traffic the moment the tunnel
  drops, so nothing leaks outside it.
- **Live stats** — real-time upload/download speed and per-server lifetime usage, via Xray's gRPC
  stats API.
- **Auto-reconnect** — detects an unexpected tunnel drop and retries with backoff.
- **Auto-update** — checks GitHub Releases, downloads the new installer with live speed and ETA,
  verifies its SHA-512, and installs it silently after a cancellable countdown. Downloads are
  resumable and land in an `Updates` folder beside the app, so declining the automatic install
  leaves a ready-to-run setup file rather than nothing.
- **Tray integration** — quick connect/disconnect and server switching without opening the window.
- **Backup & restore** — export and import all profiles, subscriptions, and settings as JSON.
- **QR sharing** — render any config as a QR code to copy or save.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **UI** | React 18 (plain JSX), hand-written CSS, Vazirmatn variable font |
| **Desktop shell** | Electron 33 |
| **Build tool** | Vite 5 |
| **Core engine** | Xray-core (bundled `xray.exe`, per architecture) |
| **Stats** | gRPC (`@grpc/grpc-js`) against Xray's StatsService |
| **Tunnel driver** | Wintun (`wintun.dll`) for TUN mode |
| **Packaging** | electron-builder (NSIS) |

The renderer talks to the main process only through a `contextBridge` preload
(`electron/preload.cjs`); `nodeIntegration` is off and the renderer is sandboxed.

## 🚀 Building from source

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer
- Git
- Windows (the app and its build targets are Windows-only)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrsoulcommunity/SoulConnection.git
cd SoulConnection
npm install
```

The `bin/` folder is not tracked in git. Before building, populate it with the Xray core and
Wintun driver:

```text
bin/
├── geoip.dat
├── geosite.dat
├── win-x64/
│   ├── xray.exe        # 64-bit Xray core
│   └── wintun.dll      # 64-bit Wintun driver
└── win-ia32/
    ├── xray.exe        # 32-bit Xray core
    └── wintun.dll      # 32-bit Wintun driver
```

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Build the UI bundle and launch Electron |
| `npm run start` | Same as `dev` |
| `npm run build:ui` | Build only the Vite renderer bundle into `dist/` |
| `npm run dist` | Build `release/setup.exe` (x64 + ia32 in one installer) |
| `npm run dist:publish` | Same as `dist`, then publish to GitHub Releases (needs `GH_TOKEN`) |
| `npm run dist:portable` | Build a single-file portable x64 executable |

## ⚙️ Where your data lives

Profiles, subscriptions, and settings are stored as a single JSON file:

- **Installed build** — `%APPDATA%\soul-connection\profiles.json`
- **Portable build** — `data\profiles.json`, next to the executable

The portable build leaves nothing behind on the host machine: delete its folder and it's gone.
